    # (built from request.url_root) comes out http:// and fails to match what's
    # registered with Google/GitHub, and request.remote_addr is the proxy — so
    # every visitor geolocates to the server itself and the whole site shares
    # one rate-limit bucket. Opt-in because these headers are client-spoofable
    # when nothing trusted is in front of the app.
    #
    # TRUST_PROXY_HOPS is how many proxies are in front of the app, and it must
    # match the deployment exactly. ProxyFix counts from the RIGHT of
    # X-Forwarded-For, so the value is "how many entries at the end of that
    # header were written by infrastructure I control".
