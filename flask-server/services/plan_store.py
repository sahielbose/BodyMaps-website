"""Plan limits, and the checks that enforce them.

The single seam for "is this account allowed to do this". Endpoints ask
``check_inference`` / ``check_ai_message`` before doing work and record usage
after; nothing else reads ``user_account.plan`` or the ``usage_event`` table.

The limit table below is mirrored in the frontend
(PanTS-Demo/src/helpers/accountProfile.ts, PLAN_LIMITS) so the UI can grey a
locked control out instead of letting you click into a 402. The server copy is
the one that decides — the frontend copy only decides how things look. Keep them
in step; a drifted frontend is a cosmetic bug, a drifted backend is a real one.

``None`` as a limit means unlimited.

Admins are outside the table: they get ``UNLIMITED`` whatever plan their account
is on, because the people running the site have to be able to exercise every
part of it. ``limits_for_user`` is where that happens, and every check goes
through it.

Nothing is charged. Upgrading is a plain column write (``set_plan``) with no
payment step, because pricing hasn't been set — but the limits on the plan you
are on are applied for real.
